# EECS442-final-project

## Gist of it
I have uploaded the thing I doodled 2 weeks ago as Scratch.pdf, which is a description for this.

## Division of Labor
Every Wed I will update the tasks for the following week in the form of git issue. Pick something you want to do then respond to the issue and remeber to update your progress.

## Workflow
We won't be using pull requests as there's no need, push to main branch freely. 
Just remeber 
never upload massive files like trained model and dataset 
don't delete other's code
always git pull before doing anything

### Have fun Coding!
